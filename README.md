# OSC-Video-To-Image-Scripts
Bash scripts which are designed to convert a video to images, blur out identifying information, crop existing images to get the street and not the car, (in a hacky way) generate fake EXIF data to trigger date modified, apply a GPX file to the images, and fix the data for uploading to OpenStreetCam. Might make this into a full blown pipeline process later.
